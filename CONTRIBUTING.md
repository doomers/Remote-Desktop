# Contributing to Remote-Desktop
Before you get started contributing to this repository, pleaseread below. This contains information to help you submit your contribution to this repository quickly and easily.


# Getting Started
1. First thing's first, before proposing any changes, you have to fork our repository to your own account. On the Github website you can do that using the button on the top right of your screen.

2. Next, before you make any change, create a new branch on your forked repository where you will make all your proposed changes. Do that by using the branch button on the top left of the Github website or if you're using git (`git checkout -b your-new-feature`).

3. Make any changes you wish.

4. Next step is to commit the changes to your forked repository. If you're using git, you can do that like this: (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).

5. Then push the changes to the branch you created earlier on your fork. Using git: (`git push origin my-new-feature`)

6. Create a pull request comparing the branch where you made your changes to the master branch of our repository.

7. Finally, in the Pull Request description fill in all the details of the changes you've made (to make things easier on whoever reviews the changes) and then make the Pull Request. That's it! We will now review your proposed changes and will communicate with you if needed for some changes accordingly and at the end, decide to merge the request or not.
